Algorithm description
=====================

I implemented an algorithm which finds a minimum cost maximum flow that uses:
- Dijkstra algorithm for finding shortest paths
- AVL tree for effective priority queue implementation
- Bellman-Ford algorithm for finding the maximum flow

The algorithm is implemented in OCaml.

Presentation
============

A presentation slides that visualise how the algorithm work are included in `presentation_slides.pdf` file. Unfortunately they are only in Polish.
